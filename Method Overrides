Notes on Method Overrides
<!--Method Overrides only work in Sinatra-->

<form method="post" action="/superheroes/<%=hero["id"]%>">
<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
<input type="submit" value="DELETE THIS PERSON">
</form>



<!--Inside class in the server.rb, placed above all the route handlers and below class Server < Sinatra::Base-->

set :method_override, true  

Notes:
For the "you are signed in as username" code, it can be pasted as is into the erb that you want, or the below if/else statement can be used if placing in layout.

<pre><% if current_user %>
		Hello, <%= current_user['username'] %>!
		<% else %>
		Please Login or Signup
		<%end %></pre>
